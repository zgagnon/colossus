/**
 * The WriteBuffer handles everything dealing properly writing raw data to the
 * SocketChannel and dealing with backpressure.
 *
 * When `write` is called on a SocketChannel in nonblocking mode, the channel
 * may not accept all of the given data, returning how many bytes it actually
 * accepted.  Therefore it is up to the WriteBuffer to handle these situations,
 * in which case it buffers the unwritten data and waits for the OP_WRITE signal
 * from the event loop to continue writing.
 *
 * WriteBuffer does not handle all aspects of write backpressure, only the most
 * immediate scenario of a partially written DataBuffer.  Every call to `write`
 * returns a WriteStatus, indicating the WriteBuffer's status in relation to the
 * given data.  In every case, a Partial status will always be returned before a
 * Zero status, so a caller that is properly reacting to the Partial status
 * should never in practice actually receive a zero status.
 *
 * The WriteBuffer works by writing all data into an internal buffer, which is
 * then drained into the SocketChannel once per event loop iteration.  This is
 * done to minimize the number of calls to SocketChannel.write, a fairly
 * expensive operation.
